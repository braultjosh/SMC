function trend = lineartrend(o)

% Returns a trend centered on zero.
%
% INPUTS
% - o       [dseries]   time series with T observations.
%
% OUTPUTS
% - trend   [double]    T*1 vector, linear trend with mean zero.
%
% REMARKS
% the generic element of the returned argument is trend(i) = i - (n+1)/2.
