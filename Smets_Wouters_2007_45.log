You did not declare endogenous variables after the estimation/calib_smoother command.
[Warning: Some of the parameters have no value (ccs, cinvs, crdpi) when using initial_estimation_checks. If these parameters are not initialized in a steadystate file or a steady_state_model-block, Dynare may not be able to solve
the model. Note that simul, perfect_foresight_setup, and perfect_foresight_solver do not automatically call the steady state file.]
